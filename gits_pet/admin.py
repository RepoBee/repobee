"""Functions for administrating repos.

This module contains functions for administrating repositories, such as
creating student repos from some master repo template. Currently, the
philosophy is that each student has an associated team with the same
name as the student's username. The team is then granted access to repos.

Each public function in this module is to be treated as a self-contained
program.
