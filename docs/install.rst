Requirements
------------
RepoBee requires Python 3.6+ and a somewhat up-to-date version of Git (2.0+ to
be on the safe side). Officially supported operating systems are Ubuntu 17.04+
and macOS, but RepoBee should run fine on any Linux distribution and also on
WSL_ on Windows 10. Please report any issues with operating systems and/or Git
versions on the `issue tracker`_.

.. _pypi:

Check your Python version
-------------------------
For RepoBee to run, you need to have Python 3.6 or later. On many operating
systems, ``python`` is an alias for Python 2.7, and ``python3`` is an alias for
the latest version of Python 3 that is installed. For this install guide,
python3 is assumed to be a Python version 3.6 or higher. You can check the
version yourself with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 --version
    # or
    $ python --version

Then, just use whichever of those Pythons claim to be 3.6 or higher.

Option 1: Install from PyPi with `pip`
--------------------------------------

The latest release of RepoBee is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual
with pip. I strongly discourage system-wide pip installs (e.g. ``sudo pip
install <package>``), as this may land you with incompatible packages in a very
short amount of time. A per-user install can be done like this:

1. Execute ``python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade repobee`` to install the package.
2. Run ``repobee -h`` to verify that you can find the script.
    - If that doesn't work, the ``repobee`` script can't be found on your PATH
      variable. Try ``python3 -m repobee -h`` to run the main module of
      RepoBee, which is equivalent to ``repobee -h``.

This same install command should also be good for upgrading RepoBee to a new
version.

.. important::

   Of course, if ``python`` corresponds to Python 3 on your system, use that
   instead of ``python3`` in the command shown above.

.. important::

    A ``--user`` install will perform a local install for the current user. Any
    scripts will be installed in a user-local bin directory. If this directory
    is not on your path (which it often is not by default), you will not be able
    to run the ``repobee`` script (however, ``python -m repobee`` should still
    work). pip should issue a warning about this, including the path to the
    local bin directory. To resolve the problem, add the local bin directory to
    your $PATH variable. When installing, pip will usually complain that the bin
    directory is not on the $PATH variable and point out where the directory is
    located.

.. _clone repo:

Option 2: Clone the repo and the install with `pip`
---------------------------------------------------
If you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release versions are uploaded
to PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this yourself, I suggest going with the release version.

1. Clone the repo with git:
    - ``git clone https://github.com/repobee/repobee``
2. ``cd`` into the project root directory with ``cd repobee``.
3. Install locally with ``pip``.
    - ``python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade .``, this will create a local
      install for the current user.
    - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.
    - For development, use ``pip install -e .[TEST]`` in a ``virtualenv``.
