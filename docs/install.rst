Requirements
------------
RepoBee requires Python 3.5+ and a somewhat up-to-date version of git.
Officially supported platforms are Ubuntu 17.04+ and macOS, but
RepoBee should run fine on any Linux distribution and also on WSL_ on
Windows 10. Please report any issues with operating systems and/or git
versions on the `issue tracker`_.

.. _pypi:

Check your Python version
-------------------------
For RepoBee to run, you need to have Python 3.5 or later. On many
operating systems, python is an alias for Python 2.7, and python3 is an
alias for the latest version of Python 3 that is installed. For this install
guide, python3 is assumed to be a Python version 3.5 or higher. You can
check the version yourself with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 --version
    # or
    $ python --version

Option 1: Install from PyPi with `pip`
--------------------------------------

The latest release of RepoBee is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual with pip.
I strongly discourage system-wide pip installs (e.g. ``sudo pip install <package>``), as this
may land you with incompatible packages in a very short amount of time. A per-user install
can be done like this:

1. Execute ``python3 -m pip install --user repobee`` to install the package.
2. Run ``repobee -h`` to verify that you can find the script.
   - If that doesn't work, the ``repobee`` script can't be found. try
   ``python3 -m repobee.main -h`` to run the main module of RepoBee
   (which is all the ``repobee`` script does anyway).

.. important::

    A ``--user`` install will perform a local install for the current user. Any
    scripts will be installed in a user-local bin directory. If this directory
    is not on your path (which it often is not by default), you will not be
    able to run the ``repobee`` script (however, ``python -m repobee.main``
    should still work). pip should issue a warning about this, including the
    path to the local bin directory. To resolve the problem, add the local bin
    directory to your $PATH variable.

.. _clone repo:

Option 2: Clone the repo and the install with `pip`
---------------------------------------------------

If you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release versions are uploaded
to PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this yourself, I suggest going with the release version.

1. Clone the repo with git:
    - ``git clone https://github.com/repobee/repobee``
2. ``cd`` into the project root directory with ``cd repobee``.
3. Install the requirements with ``python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt``
    - To be able to run the tests, you must install the ``requirements.test.txt`` file.
4. Install locally with ``pip``.
    - ``python3 -m pip install --user .``, this will create a local install for the current user.
    - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.
    - For development, use ``pip install -e .`` in a ``virtualenv``.
