Getting started (the ``show-config``, ``verify-settings`` and ``setup`` commands)
*********************************************************************************
.. important::

    This guide assumes that the user has access to a ``bash`` shell, or is
    tech-savvy enough to translate the instructions into some other shell
    environment.

.. important::

   Whenever you see specific mentions of GitHub, refer to the :ref:`gitlab`
   section for how this translates to use with GitLab.

The basic workflow of RepoBee is best described by example. In this section,
I will walk you through how to set up a target organization with master and
student repositories by showing every single step I would perform myself. The
basic workflow can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Create an organization (the target organization).
2. Configure RepoBee for the target organization.
3. Verify settings.
4. Set up the master repos.
5. Set up the student repos.

This should leave you with enough knowledge to use the rudimentary features of
RepoBee. There is much more to RepoBee, such as opening/closing issues,
updating student repos and cloning repos in batches. This is covered in later
sections, but you don't necessarily need to go through the entire guide in one
go. Now, let's delve into the above steps in greater detail.

Create an organization
======================
This is an absolutely necessary pre-requisite for using RepoBee.
Create an organization with an appropriate name on the platform instance you
intend to use. You can find the ``New organization`` button by going to
``Settings -> Organization``. I will call my *target organization*
``repobee-demo``, so whenever you see that, substitute in the name of your
target organization.

.. important::

    At KTH, we most often do not want our students to be able to see each
    others' repos. By default, however, members have read access to *all*
    repos. To change this, go to the organization dashboard and find your way
    to ``Settings -> Member privileges``. There should be a drop-down called
    something along the lines of "Base permissions" or "Default repository
    settings", which you will want to set to ``None``. The placement and name
    of this drop-down has changed places twice since the first iteration of
    this documentation, so it may not be an exact match, but you should find it
    somewhere around there.

.. _configure_repobee:

Configure RepoBee for the target organization (``show-config`` and ``verify-settings``)
=======================================================================================
For the tool to work at all, it needs to be provided with an access token to
whichever platform instance you intend to use. See the `GitHub access token
docs`_ for how to create a token. The token should have the ``repo`` and
``admin:org`` scopes.

.. note::

   See :ref:`gitlab access token` if you use GitLab!

While you can set this token in an environment variable
(see :ref:`configuration`), it's more convenient to just put it in the
configuration file, as you will put other default values in there. The
``config-wizard`` command starts a configuration wizard that prompts you for
default values for the available settings. The defaults that are set in the
configuration file are *just defaults*, and can always be overridden on the
command line. For the rest of this guide, I will assume that the config file
has defaults for at least the following:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: config.ini

   [repobee]
   base_url = https://some-enterprise-host/api/v3
   user = slarse
   org_name = repobee-demo
   master_org_name = master-repos
   token = SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN

Now, run ``repobee config-wizard`` and enter your own values for the options
shown above. To skip an option, simply press ENTER without first typing in a
value. Here are some pointers regarding the different values:

* Enter the correct url for your platform instance. There are two options:
    - If you are working with GitHub Enterprise, simply replace
      ``some-enterprise-host`` with the appropriate hostname.
    - If you are working with ``github.com``, replace the whole url
      with ``https://api.github.com``.
* Replace ``slarse`` with your GitHub username.
* Replace ``repobee-demo`` with whatever you named your target organization.
* Replace ``SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN`` with your access token.
* Replace ``master_org_name`` with the name of the organization with your master repos.
    - It you keep the master repos in the target organization or locally, **skip
      this option**.
* **If you are using GitLab**:
    - The ``base_url`` should be to the host, not to the API endpoint. I.e. if
      you are using https://gitlab.com, then the ``base_url`` option should
      simply read ``https://gitlab.com``.
    - Enter ``gitlab`` for the ``plugins`` option.

That's it for configuration. The ``show-config`` command can be used to check
that you got everything correctly.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ repobee show-config
    [INFO] Found valid config file at /home/slarse/.config/repobee/config.ini
    [INFO]
    ----------------BEGIN CONFIG FILE-----------------
    [repobee]
    base_url = https://some-enterprise-host/api/v3
    user = slarse
    org_name = repobee-demo
    master_org_name = master-repos
    token = SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN
    -----------------END CONFIG FILE------------------

If you ever want to re-configure some of the options, simply run the
``config-wizard`` command again.

Verify settings
===============

.. important::

   ``verify-settings`` is not yet supported by the ``gitlab`` plugin.

Now that everything is set up, it's time to verify all of the settings. Given
that you have a configuration file that looks something like the one above,
you can simply run the ``verify-settings`` command without any options.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ repobee verify-settings
    [INFO] Verifying settings ...
    [INFO] Trying to fetch user information ...
    [INFO] SUCCESS: found user slarse, user exists and base url looks okay
    [INFO] Verifying access token scopes ...
    [INFO] SUCCESS: access token scopes look okay
    [INFO] Trying to fetch organization ...
    [INFO] SUCCESS: found organization test-tools
    [INFO] Verifying that user slarse is an owner of organization repobee-demo
    [INFO] SUCCESS: user slarse is an owner of organization repobee-demo
    [INFO] Trying to fetch organization master-repos ...
    [INFO] SUCCESS: found organization master-repos
    [INFO] Verifying that user slarse is an owner of organization master-repos
    [INFO] SUCCESS: user slarse is an owner of organization master-repos
    [INFO] GREAT SUCCESS: All settings check out!

If any of the checks fail, you should be provided with a semi-helpful error
message. When all checks pass and you get ``GREAT SUCCESS``, move on to the next
section!

Set up master repos
=======================
How you do this will depend on where you want to have your master repos. I
recommend having a separate, persistent organization so that you can work on
repos across course rounds. If you already have a master organization with your
master repos set up somewhere, and ``master_org_name`` is specified in the
config, you're good to go. If you need to migrate repos into the target
organization (e.g. if you keep master repos in the target organization), see
the :ref:`migrate` section. For all commands but the ``migrate`` command, the
way you set this up does not matter as far as RepoBee commands go.

.. note::

   Recall that there is nothing special about master repos, they are just your
   templates for student repos. If you have an organization set up with template
   repositories, then that is a viable master organization.

.. _setup:

Set up student repositories
===========================
Now that the master repos are set up, it's time to create the student repos.
While student usernames *can* be specified on the command line, it's often
convenient to have them written down in a file instead. Let's pretend I have
three students with usernames ``slarse``, ``glassey`` and ``glennol``. I'll
simply create a file called ``students.txt`` and type each username on a
separate line.

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: students.txt

    slarse
    glassey
    glennol

.. note::

   **Since v1.3.0:** It is now possible to specify groups of students to get
   access to the same repos by putting multiple usernames on the same line,
   separated by spaces. For example, the following file will put `slarse` and
   `glassey` in the same group.

   .. code-block:: bash

      slarse glassey
      glennol

   See :ref:`groups` for details.

An absolute file path to this file can be added to the config file with the
``students_file`` option (see :ref:`config`). Since I often manage different
sets of students, that's seldom convenient for me, but if you always manage the
same set of students I recommend setting that option so you can omit it from the
command line arguments. Now, I want to create one student repo for each master
repo and student. The repo names will be on the form
``<username>-<master-repo-name>``, guaranteeing their uniqueness. Each student
will also be added to a team (which bears the same name as the student's user),
and it is the team that is allowed access to the student's repos, not the
student's actual user. That all sounded fairly complex, but again, it's as
simple as issuing a single command with RepoBee.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ repobee setup -a task-1 task-2 --sf students.txt
    [INFO] Cloning into master repos ...
    [INFO] Cloning into file:///home/slarse/tmp/task-1

    [INFO] Pushed files to https://some-enterprise-host/repobee-demo/slarse-task-2 master

.. note::

   If you have specified the ``students_file`` option in the config file, then
   you don't need to specify ``--sf students.txt`` on the command line. Remember
   also that options specified on the command line always take precedence over
   those in the configuration file, so you can override the default students
   file if you wish by specifying ``--sf``..

Note that there was a ``[WARNING]`` message for the username ``glennol``: the
user does not exist. At KTH, this is common, as many (sometimes most) first-time
students will not have created their GitHub accounts until sometime after the
course starts. These students will still have their repos created, but the users
need to be added to their teams at a later time (to do this, simply run the
``setup`` command again for these students, once they have created accounts).
This is one reason why we use teams for access privileges: it's easy to set
everything up even when the students have yet to create their accounts (given
that their usernames are pre-determined).

And that's it for setting up the course, the organization is primed and the
students should have access to their repositories!
