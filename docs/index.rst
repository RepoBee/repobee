   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to gits_pet's documentation!
==================================================
If you are new to ``gits_pet``, the :ref:`fundamentals` and
:ref:`getting_started` sections are must-reads. Developers looking to modify
or utilize the core functionality in ways the CLI does not allow will be best
served by looking at the :ref:`modindex`.

Please open an issue and tag it with the ``docs`` tag for any bugs or missing
information.
