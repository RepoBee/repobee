Welcome to RepoBee's documentation!
==================================================

If you are new to RepoBee, the :ref:`fundamentals` and :ref:`userguide`
sections are must-reads. Developers looking to work on RepoBee, or fork it, are
probably most interested in the :ref:`modindex`. Developers looking to create
plugins should head over to the :ref:`repobee-plug`.

If you use the :ref:`userguide` in any way and feel like skipping
:ref:`getting_started`, make sure to read :ref:`configure_repobee` anyway! The
rest of the guide assumes a configuration as described there.

The entire core CLI (i.e. without plugins) is also documented in the
:ref:`cli`. This is both handy as reference material for existing users, and
for prospective users to get a clear understanding of what RepoBee can do.

.. hint::

    Having issues? Check the :ref:`faq` to see if you can find a solution for
    your problem.

.. important::

   Please open an issue over on the `issue tracker
   <https://github.com/repobee/repobee/issues/new>`_ if you find documentation
   bugs, have trouble understanding something or think something is missing.
   Especially when it comes to the userguide, which is intended to be as
   intuitive as possible, please do provide feedback if you get stuck.
