   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to repomate's documentation!
==================================================
If you are new to ``repomate``, the :ref:`fundamentals` and
:ref:`userguide` sections are must-reads. Developers looking to modify
or utilize the core functionality in ways the CLI does not allow will be best
served by looking at the :ref:`modindex`.

.. important::
    
    If you use the :ref:`userguide` in any way and feel like skipping
    :ref:`getting_started`, make sure to read :ref:`configure_repomate` anyway!
    The rest of the guide assumes a configuration as described there.

Please open an issue and tag it with the ``docs`` tag for any bugs or missing
information.
