   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to RepoBee's documentation!
==================================================

If you are new to RepoBee, the :ref:`fundamentals` and :ref:`userguide`
sections are must-reads. Developers looking to work on RepoBee, or fork it, are
probably most interested in the :ref:`modindex`. Developers looking to create
plugins should head over to the documentation for `repobee-plug
<https://repobee-plug.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_.

If you use the :ref:`userguide` in any way and feel like skipping
:ref:`getting_started`, make sure to read :ref:`configure_repobee` anyway!  The
rest of the guide assumes a configuration as described there.

.. important::

   Please open an issue over on the `issue tracker
   <https://github.com/repobee/repobee/issues/new>`_ if you find documentation
   bugs, have trouble understanding something or think something is missing.
   Especially when it comes to the userguide, which is intended to be as
   intuitive as possible, please do provide feedback if you get stuck.
