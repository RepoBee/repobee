Peer review (``assign-peer-reviews`` and ``purge-peer-review-teams`` commands)
******************************************************************************

New in ``v0.4.0`` are the ``assign-peer-reviews`` and
``purge-peer-review-teams`` commands, which bring basic peer review
functionality to ``repomate``. Like much of the
other functionality in ``repomate``, the peer review functionality is built
around teams and limited access privileges. In short, every student repo up for
review gets an associated peer review team generated, which has ``pull`` access
to the repo. Each student then gets added to ``0 < N < num_students`` peer
review teams, and are to open a peer review issue in the associated repos.
Let's have a closer look at how this is managed.

.. note::

    A third command, ``check-peer-review-progress``, is planned for ``v0.5.0``.
    With this command, it will be possible to quickly get an overview of which
    students have opened peer review issues, and which have not.

.. _assign reviews:

Getting started with peer reviews using ``assign-peer-reviews``
=================================================================
The bulk of the work is performed by ``assign-peer-reviews``. Let's have a
look at the help message (i.e. run ``repomate assign-peer-reviews -h``):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ repomate assign-peer-reviews -h
    usage: repomate assign-peer-reviews [-h]
                                        (-sf STUDENTS_FILE | -s STUDENTS [STUDENTS ...])
                                        [-o ORG_NAME] [-g GITHUB_BASE_URL] [-tb]
                                        -mn MASTER_REPO_NAMES
                                        [MASTER_REPO_NAMES ...] -n NUM_REVIEWS
                                        [-i ISSUE]

    For each student repo, create a review team with pull access named
    <student>-<master_repo_name>-review and randomly assign other students to it.
    All students are assigned to the same amount of review teams, as specified by
    `--num-reviews`

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -sf STUDENTS_FILE, --students-file STUDENTS_FILE
                            Path to a list of student usernames.
      -s STUDENTS [STUDENTS ...], --students STUDENTS [STUDENTS ...]
                            One or more whitespace separated student usernames.
      -o ORG_NAME, --org-name ORG_NAME
                            Name of the organization to which repos should be
                            added.
      -g GITHUB_BASE_URL, --github-base-url GITHUB_BASE_URL
                            Base url to a GitHub v3 API. For enterprise, this is
                            usually `https://<HOST>/api/v3`
      -tb, --traceback      Let any exceptions propagate up so that the full
                            traceback can be viewed.
      -mn MASTER_REPO_NAMES [MASTER_REPO_NAMES ...], --master-repo-names MASTER_REPO_NAMES [MASTER_REPO_NAMES ...]
                            One or more names of master repositories. Names must
                            either refer to local directories, or to master
                            repositories in the target organization.
      -n N, --num-reviews N
                            Assign each student to review n repos (consequently,
                            each repo is reviewed by n students). n must be
                            strictly smaller than the amount of students.
      -i ISSUE, --issue ISSUE
                            Path to an issue to open in student repos. If
                            specified, this issue will be opened in each student
                            repo, and the body will be prepended with user
                            mentions of all students assigned to review the repo.
                            NOTE: The first line is assumed to be the title.

Most of this, we've seen before. The only non-standard arguments are
``--issue`` and ``--num-reviews``, the former of which we've actually already
seen in the ``open-issues`` command (see :ref:`open`). I will assume that both
``--github-base-url`` and ``--org-name`` are already configured in the
configuration file (if you don't know what this mean, have a look at
:ref:`config`). Thus, the only things we must specify are
``--students/--students-file`` and ``--num-reviews`` (``--issue`` is optional,
more on that later). Let's make a minimal call with the
``assign-peer-reviewers`` command, and then inspect the log output to figure
out what happened. Recall that ``students.txt`` lists our three favorite
students spam, ham and eggs (see :ref:`setup`).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ repomate assign-peer-reviews -mn master-repo-1 -s spam ham eggs --num-reviews 2
    [INFO] config file defaults:

       github_base_url: https://some-enterprise-host/api/v3

    [INFO] opened issue spam-master-repo-1/#2-'Peer review'
    [INFO] adding team spam-master-repo-1-review to repo spam-master-repo-1 with 'pull' permission

The following steps were performed:

1. One review team per repo was created (``<student>-master-repo-1-review``).
2. Two students were added to each review team. Note that these allocations are
   _random_. For obvious resons, there can be at most ``num_students-1`` peer
   reviews per repo. So, in this case, we are at the maximum.
3. An issue was opened in each repo with the title ``Peer review``, and a body
   saying something like ``You should peer review this repo.``. The review team
   students were assigned to the issue as well (although this is not apparent
   from the logging).
4. The review teams were added to their corresponding repoos with ``pull``
   permission. This permission allows members of the team to view the repo and
   open issues, but they can't push to (and therefore can't modify) the repo.

That's it for the basic functionality. The intent is that students should open
an issue in every repo they are to peer review, with a specific title. The title
can then be regexed in the upcoming ``check-peer-review-progress`` to see which
students assigned to the different peer review teams have created their review
issue. Of course, other schemes can be cooked up, but that is my current vision
of how I myself will use it. Now, let's talk a bit about that ``--issue``
argument.

Specifying a custom issue
-------------------------
The default issue is really meant to be replaced with something more specific to
the course and assignment. For example, say that there were five tasks in the 
``master-repo-2`` repo, and the students should review tasks 2 and 3 based on
some criteria. It would then be beneficial to specify this in the peer review
issue, so we'll write up our own little issue to replace the default one.
Remember that the first line is taken to be the title, in exactly the same way
as issue files are treated in :ref:`open`.

.. code-block:: none

    Review of master-repo-2

    Hello! The students assigned to this issue have been tasked to review this
    repo. Each of you should open _one_ issue with the title `Peer review` and
    the following content:

    ## Task 2
    ### Code style
    Comments on code style, such as readability and general formatting.

    ### Time complexity
    Is the algorithm O(n)? If not, try to figure out what time complexity it is
    and point out what could have been done better.

    ## Task 3
    ### Code style
    Comments on code style, such as readabilty and general formatting.

Assuming the file was saved as ``issue.md``, we can now run the command
specifying the issue like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ repomate assign-peer-reviews -mn master-repo-2 -sf students.txt --num-reviews 2 --issue issue.md
    [INFO] config file defaults:

       github_base_url: https://some-enterprise-host/api/v3
       user: slarse
       org_name: repomate-demo

    [INFO] opened issue ham-master-repo-2/#2-'Review of master-repo-2'
    [INFO] adding team ham-master-repo-2-review to repo ham-master-repo-2 with 'pull' permission
    [INFO] opened issue spam-master-repo-2/#2-'Review of master-repo-2'
    [INFO] adding team spam-master-repo-2-review to repo spam-master-repo-2 with 'pull' permission 

As you can tell from the last few lines, the title is the one specified in the
issue, and not the default title as it was before. And that's pretty much it for
setting up the peer review repos.

Cleaning up peer review teams with ``purge-peer-review-teams``
==============================================================
The one downside of using teams for access privileges is that we bloat the
organization with a ton of teams. Once the deadline has passed and all peer
reviews are done, there is little reason to keep them (in my mind). Therefore,
the ``purge-peer-review-teams`` command can be used to remove all peer review
teams for a given set of student repos. Let's say that we're completely done
with the peer reviews of ``master-repo-1``, and want to remove the review teams.
It's as simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ repomate purge-peer-review-teams -mn master-repo-1 -sf students.txt
    [INFO] config file defaults:

       github_base_url: https://some-enterprise-host/api/v3
       user: slarse
       org_name: repomate-demo
       
    [INFO] deleted team eggs-master-repo-1-review
    [INFO] deleted team ham-master-repo-1-review
    [INFO] deleted team spam-master-repo-1-review

And that's it, the review teams are gone. If you also want to close the related
issues, you can simply use the ``close-issues`` command for that (see
:ref:`close`). ``purge-peer-review-teams`` plays one more important role: 
if you mess something up when assigning the peer reviews. The next section
details how you can deal with such a scenario.

Messing up and getting back on track
====================================
Let's say you messed something up with allocating the peer reviews. For example,
if you left out a student, there is no easy way to rectify the allocations such
that that student is included. Let's say we did just that, and forgot to include
the student ``cabbage`` in the reviews for ``master-repo-2`` back at
:ref:`assign reviews`. We then do the following:

1. Check if any reviews have already been posted. This can easily be performed
   with ``repomate list-issues -mn master-repo-2 -sf students.txt -r '^Peer
   review$'`` (assuming the naming conventions were followed!). Take appropriate
   action if you find any reviews already posted (appropriate being anything you
   see fit to alleviate the situation of affected students possibly being
   assigned new repos to review).
2. Purge the review teams with ``repomate purge-review-teams -mn master-repo-2
   -sf students.txt``
3. Close all review issues with ``repomate close-issues -mn master-repo-2 -sf
   students.txt -r '^Review of master-repo-2$'``
4. Create a new ``issue.md`` file apologetically explaining that you messed up:

.. code-block:: none
    
    Review of master-repo-2 (for real this time!)

    Sorry, I messed up with the allocations previously. Disregard the previous
    allocations (repo access has been revoked anyway).

5. Assign peer reviews again, with the new issue, with repomate
   ``assign-peer-reviews -mn master-repo-2 -sf students.txt --num-reviews 2
   --issue issue.md``

And that's it! Disaster averted.
