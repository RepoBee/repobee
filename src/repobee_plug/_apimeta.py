"""Metaclass for API implementations.

:py:class:`APIMeta` defines the behavior required of platform API
implementations, based on the methods in :py:class:`APISpec`. With platform
API, we mean for example the GitHub REST API, and the GitLab REST API. The
point is to introduce another layer of indirection such that higher levels of
RepoBee can use different platforms in a platform-independent way.
:py:class:`API` is a convenience class so consumers don't have to use the
metaclass directly.

Any class implementing a platform API should derive from :py:class:`API`. It
will enforce that all public methods are one of the method defined py
:py:class:`APISpec`, and give a default implementation (that just raises
NotImplementedError) for any unimplemented API methods.
